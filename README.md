Hi there!!

This is PET project with React & redux toolkit steak.

Project uses TypeScript for typisation modules and vars, Redux as state manager and Vite for compiling all modules.

For run this project use this commands:

1. run fake server (npm json server): npm run server
2. run dev mode in Vite: npm run dev

This project shows fake tickets service with async uploading array with information about flights.
Projects have adaptive styles by SASS prepors and can by used in monitors from 425px weigth (lower not recomended, but works).

In this case were realised sort function in 3 ways:

- fastes
- cheapest
- optimaised

Also were realised 2 filtres:

- filter by company (selection by radio button)
- filter by connection counts (multy-selection by checkbox buttons)

At last added "Load-more" button wich upload 3 new cads with fligth information from fake server.
